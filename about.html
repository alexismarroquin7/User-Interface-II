                My name is Alexis Marroquin. 
                I am an 18 years old and from the Bay Area.
                I have been a full-stack web 
                developer for 1 year.
                I graduated from Lambda School in 
                the Summer of 2021.
                Also, I have been an audio producer for 5 years.
                I produce and mix intrumentals and
                music with vocals. Additionally, I speak
                three languages: English, Spanish, and 
                Brazilian Portuguese.
            </p>
            <p>
                My interests include, but are not limited to comedy,
                music, drawing/painting, and radio/podcasting.
                I like to listen to comedy shows like 
                "Two Bears, One Cave" hosted by Tom Segura and 
                Bert Kreisher in the morning when
                I am getting ready to start my day.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am fascinated with learning about different
                cultures and foods. I watch brazilian television
                when I want to practice my Portuguese,
                but don't feel like doing to much work. My favorite
                TV show in Brazilian Portuguese is 'Pesadelo
                Na Cozinha', which is the brazilian version of 
                'Kitchen Nightmares'.
